            <p>
              The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) helps employers in
              England, Wales and Scotland make safer recruitment decisions and
              prevent unsuitable people from working with vulnerable groups,
              including children. The DBS decides whether it is suitable for a
              person to be placed on or removed from a barred list.
