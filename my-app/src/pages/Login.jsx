          <p>
            By registering yourself as a helper, Our adult volunteers get just
            as much out of Scouting as our young people do. As well as helping
            young people to enjoy the adventure of Scouting, youâ€™ll also have
            fun, make friends, develop new skills and have unforgettable
            experiences.
